# Udacity_AI-Product-Manager
This was my 2nd Nanodegree Program from Udacity. This contains 3 projects.


AI Product Manager
You’ll learn how to evaluate the business value of an AI product. You’ll start by building familiarity and fluency with common AI concepts. You’ll then learn how to scope and build a data set, train a model, and evaluate its business impact. Finally, you’ll learn how to ensure a product is successful by focusing on scalability, potential biases, and compliance. Along the way, you’ll review case studies and examples to help you focus on how to define metrics to measure the business value for a proposed product.
